# fp3-ssh — SSH/scp to the FP3 dev device (pmOS) over the stable NCM link.
#
# Prefers key authentication ($FP3_SSH_KEY, installed once with
# `fp3-link install-key`), which removes the password and sshpass from every
# call and makes post-reboot reconnects instant. Falls back to the password if
# no key is installed yet.
#
# On ssh's own transport failure it flushes the stale neighbour entry and
# retries: the gadget picks a fresh random MAC on every boot, so the host is
# otherwise left talking to the previous MAC and reports "No route to host" for
# a link that is in fact fine. That was the usual reason for reaching for the
# cable; see "Unattended access" in the repository README.
#
# NEVER pokes the USB layer.
#
#   fp3-ssh                       # interactive shell
#   fp3-ssh 'md5sum ...'          # run a command (remote exit status passed through)
#   fp3-ssh --scp SRC DEST        # scp SRC to fp3:DEST

# Config lives in fp3-env.sh; every value there has a documented default.
# Resolve symlinks first: these scripts are commonly installed as symlinks in
# /usr/local/bin, where a bare $0 would look for fp3-env.sh next to the symlink.

# ☠️ THE MEASUREMENT LOCK (fp3-measure). A run that is measuring how long this

# manual call sees the same one, and it is checked in the SAME connection this
# call was going to make anyway, so it costs no extra login. It FAILS OPEN: if
# the check cannot run, the command proceeds.
